    "I'm a Lower Mid Level Web Developer. But an OG machine learning enthusiast (I know, but I can't do it). I'm an Information Technology graduate with a sub-par GPA. I'm Unemployed, So So Sooooooo Broke. Oww, Btw I'm a youtuber too. I'm a leetcode problem solver with  a rating of 1512. I also have a Discord server where I take porgramming classes. I'm proficient in Django, Tensorflow, React, and Bootstrap. I like to build things, And I 'm going to build the biggest bangladeshi Progremmers community. I'm determined to make a lasting impact in the tech industry.",
